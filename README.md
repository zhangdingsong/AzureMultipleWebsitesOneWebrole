# Host Multiple Websites within One Azure WebRole using VisualStudio 2015

##Introduction
An example of how to host multiple websites within one Azure webrole using Visual Studio 2015. This is a supplement and implement of Azure official video: [Multiple Websites in a Web Role](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Cloud+Cover/Cloud-Cover-Episode-37-Multiple-Websites-in-a-Web-Role).  Because that post is dated 2011, maybe updates for the past years allows for a more friendly and better approach. This post will give you the latest version of implementation.
